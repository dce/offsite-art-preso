# Dev Offsite Art Project

Or rather, we're going to write some code  
to make some art.

# Dev Offsite Art Project

* You'll have 90 minutes to write a program
  * That generates an 800x600 PNG file
* The program should generate new art every time
  * (some degree of randomness)
* Your submission will be submitted as a PR to a shared repository
  * (code + a single image)
* Team up if you want, but solo fine too

---

## Scoring

* Judges' score (3 x 1-10)
* Language
  * Primary language / dedicated graphics tool (e.g. Processing) (0)
  * Secondary language / other Viget core language (2)
  * Language David knows you've used (4)
  * Totally new language (6)
  * Language David's never heard of (10)
* Viget tenure ((David - you) / 2)
* Bonus: include a Viget logo (5)
* Bonus: help someone else (1 / person)

## Additional Considerations

* Someone else should reasonably be able to run your program
  * i.e. prefer open-source
* Don't come w/ an existing solution
  * Starter repo OK
  * Might make sense to have known libraries pulled down
  * No copy/paste
  * And don't directly copy someone else's algorithm
* You/your program should be the primary artist
  * It should pretty directly be putting pixels into the image
  * Don't just use like Stable Diffusion
